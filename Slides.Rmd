## CoEDL Summer School 2019 - Advanced Statistics for Linguists (coedlstatzr)

**Before we begin**

- All you will ever need - for this work shop - is in the folder I sent.

- If you have not received my email type the following into your browser to automatically download that folder <https://martinschweinberger.de/docs/materials/AdvancedStatzForLinguists.zip>

- Unzip wherever you please and open it!

- All code and more elaborate explanations of what we will cover is available at the website of the *Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory* (LADAL)   <https://slcladal.github.io/index.html>

LADAL is hosted by the *School of Languages and Cultures* of The University of Queensland, Australia (UQ)

## About this Course

What will we cover?

- Simple linear regression
- Fixed-effects regression (linear | logistic)
- Mixed-effects regression (linear | logistic | quasi-poisson)
- Tree-based models (Conditional Inference Trees | Random Forests | Boruta)

Aims

- Understand these methods
- Use these methods
- Being aware of their advantages|disadvantages|problems|issues

## About this Course

Why is this course relevant for researchers that already know statistics?

- Best Practices emerge only with time
- Different people know different things (I have never not learned anything when I attended a lecture about sth I already "knew")
- Tips and tricks about model fitting and model diagnostics
- Adding and sharing to this course (*please* let us know if you have tips, tricks, or experience with sth: we are *all* here to learn!)

## About this Course

What this course is *not*

- This is not an introduction to statistics 
- This is not an introduction to R

What will we *not* cover?

- Basic concepts (probability, significance, etc.) 
- Yes, everything is done in R but we cannot go into how R works
- The mathematical underpinning of the models (unless absolutely necessary)
- Technical trouble shooting (cry for help and the assistants will come and assist in crying)

## Assistance: who we gonna call?

```{r c1, echo=F, fig.cap=c("Catalina Torres", "Leonard Freeman"), message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='20%'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/Catalina.jpg", "images/Leonard.jpg"))
```


## Timeline

**Session 1 (Thursday 10:00 to 11:30)**

- Introduction and set up
- Simple linear and multiple fixed-effects regression

**Session 2 (Thursday 9:00 to 10:30)**

- More multiple fixed-effects regression and start with mixed-effects regression

**Session 3 (Friday 11:00 to 12:30)**

- Mixed-effects regression

**Session 4 (Friday 11:00 to 12:30)**

- Tree-based models
- Wrap-up and goodbye

## Why R?

Good reasons for using R

- Free open-source software
- Fully-fledged programming environment
- Enables and enhances full reproducibility | replicability of your research (enables Best Practices)
- Can be used for data science | management | processing | visualization | analytics | presentation
- Massive and friendly support-infrastructure 

## Recommendations

Things that I wish I had done | known earlier

- Use R projects (Rproj)
- Use tidyverse (yes, I was brought up with base R and still haven't fully adapted)
- Create a GitHub and/or GitLab account and connect R to Git (version control, forking, cloud storage)
- You can use R to create websites (LADAL), apps (Shiny), slides (like these), publications (Rpub)
- You can do NLP, data management, data visualization, data analytics all in R
- R allows geo-spatial visualizations (maps)

## What will come next?

Trends that - I believe | predict - will become more frequent in the future

- Mixed-models
- Bayesian mixed-models (problem with frequentist approach: we evaluate the probability of H~1~ via the H~0~ rather than directly)
- Interactive apps (Shiny for public outreach | schools: to allow students to discover language and make things about language more well-known)
- Replication, Open Data | Science, collaborative research (hopefully)
- Entering new fields (e.g. History, Cultural and Literary Studies)

## Where from here?

Books about statistics that I can recommend (for beginners)

- @field2012discovering, @levshina2015linguistics, @gries2009statistics, @agresti1996introduction

Books about statistics that I can recommend (for advanced)

- @baayen2008analyzing, @agresti2011categorical, @pinheiro2000mixedmodels, @zuur2009mixedmodels
